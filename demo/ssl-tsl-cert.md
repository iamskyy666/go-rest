## 🧩 Step-by-Step Breakdown

We ran this command:

```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365
```

This command uses **OpenSSL**, a powerful cryptographic toolkit, to generate a **self-signed SSL/TLS certificate** — the same kind of thing websites use for HTTPS connections (🔒).

Let’s decode it **piece by piece** 👇

---

### 1. `openssl req`

This tells OpenSSL to **create a new certificate request** (CSR = Certificate Signing Request).
But since we also used `-x509`, it means we’re actually generating a **self-signed certificate** (no external Certificate Authority needed).

---

### 2. `-x509`

This flag means:

> “Create a self-signed certificate instead of a signing request.”

That’s useful for **local development** (when we don’t have or need a trusted SSL certificate from Let’s Encrypt, GoDaddy, etc.).

---

### 3. `-newkey rsa:2048`

This generates a **new RSA key pair** with a key size of **2048 bits**.

RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman) is an asymmetric cryptographic algorithm used for:

* Encryption/decryption
* Authentication (verifying identity)

Essentially, this gives us:

* A **private key** → `key.pem`
* A **public key** embedded inside the certificate → `cert.pem`

---

### 4. `-nodes`

Means “**no DES encryption**” — i.e., **don’t password-protect the private key**.

In production, we’d usually password-protect the key.
But for local development, this flag saves us from typing a password every time the Go app starts.

---

### 5. `-keyout key.pem`

This specifies where to save the **private key** file.
We’ll end up with:

```
key.pem
```

This file must be kept **secret** — it’s what identifies our server.

---

### 6. `-out cert.pem`

This specifies the name of the **public certificate** file that will be created.
This is what the browser/client will see and use to verify the server.

---

### 7. `-days 365`

Sets the **validity period** of the certificate (1 year in this case).

---

## 🧠 Why Are We Doing This?

Because we are about to make our Go API **run over HTTPS**, not just HTTP.

### HTTP vs HTTPS

| Feature    | HTTP                         | HTTPS                        |
| ---------- | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Protocol   | HyperText Transfer Protocol  | HTTP Secure (HTTP + TLS/SSL) |
| Port       | 80                           | 443                          |
| Encryption | ❌ None                       | ✅ Encrypted                  |
| Safety     | Data is visible in plaintext | Data is encrypted end-to-end |

So by generating `key.pem` and `cert.pem`, we’re preparing our Go Fiber server to use **HTTPS** locally.

---

## ⚙️ How This Connects to Go Fiber (or any Go HTTP server)

After generating the files, we’ll usually modify our Go code like this:

```go
package main

import (
	"log"
	"github.com/gofiber/fiber/v2"
)

func main() {
	app := fiber.New()

	app.Get("/", func(c *fiber.Ctx) error {
		return c.SendString("🔒 Secure API running over HTTPS!")
	})

	// Run HTTPS server
	log.Fatal(app.ListenTLS(":443", "cert.pem", "key.pem"))
}
```

### What’s happening here:

* `app.ListenTLS` is the **secure** version of `app.Listen`.
* It tells Fiber to use the SSL/TLS certificate and private key we just generated.
* Requests are now encrypted before being sent/received.

---

## 🧱 Under the Hood: What Actually Happens

When a client (like a browser or Postman) connects over HTTPS:

1. The server presents its **certificate (`cert.pem`)**.
2. The client uses the **public key** in that certificate to establish a secure encryption session.
3. Both sides negotiate a **shared secret key** (session key).
4. All data exchanged after that is encrypted using the session key.

💡 Even though the certificate here is *self-signed* (not verified by a trusted Certificate Authority), it’s totally fine for local testing. The browser or Postman may show a “Not Secure” warning — that’s expected because the cert isn’t trusted globally.

---

## 🧰 Summary

| Step                  | Purpose                                   |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Generate cert & key   | Create local HTTPS credentials            |
| Use `app.ListenTLS()` | Launch Fiber server securely              |
| HTTPS benefit         | Encrypt data between client & server      |
| Self-signed cert      | Fine for local dev, not for production    |
| Private key           | Keep it safe; it’s our server’s identity |

---

## 🧠 1️⃣ What Is TLS?

**TLS (Transport Layer Security)** is a *cryptographic protocol* that secures communication between two computers over a network — usually between:

* A **client** (browser, mobile app, Postman, etc.)
* A **server** (our Go API, backend, etc.)

It ensures three major things:

| Security Goal      | Description                                                                                        |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Encryption**     | Data exchanged between client & server is **encrypted** (no one can read it, even if intercepted). |
| **Integrity**      | Data cannot be **altered or tampered with** during transmission.                                   |
| **Authentication** | The client can verify that it’s actually talking to the **real server** (not an imposter).         |

---

## 🔐 2️⃣ How TLS Works (in short)

When a browser or client connects to our Go server via HTTPS:

1. **Handshake begins** — The client asks the server to identify itself.
2. **Server sends its certificate (`cert.pem`)**, which contains its **public key**.
3. The client checks the certificate’s validity.
4. The client and server then generate a **shared secret key** (session key).
5. All further data is **encrypted** using that session key.

So TLS is basically a **secure tunnel** for HTTP — hence the term **HTTPS**

> HTTP + TLS = HTTPS

---

## ⚙️ 3️⃣ What the Code Is Doing (TLS Part Only)

Let’s zoom in on these key sections 👇

---

### 🧩 Loading the Certificates

```go
cert := "cert.pem"
key  := "key.pem"
```

These are the two files we generated earlier using `openssl`:

* `cert.pem` → The **public certificate** (sent to clients)
* `key.pem` → The **private key** (kept secret by the server)

Together, they form the cryptographic identity of our server.

---

### 🧩 Configuring TLS

```go
tlsConfig := &tls.Config{
    MinVersion: tls.VersionTLS12,
}
```

Here, we create a **TLS configuration object**.

* `MinVersion: tls.VersionTLS12` means:
  ➜ “Don’t allow older, insecure versions like TLS 1.0 or 1.1.”
  ➜ Only accept **TLS 1.2 or newer**, which are much more secure.

🧠 Under the hood:
This `tls.Config` struct holds security settings — cipher suites, certificates, and protocol versions.
We can even customize it to enforce stronger encryption, client certificates, etc.

---

### 🧩 Creating the Server

```go
server := http.Server{
    Addr: fmt.Sprintf(":%d", PORT),
    Handler: nil,
    TLSConfig: tlsConfig,
}
```

We’re manually creating an `http.Server` instance instead of using the simpler `http.ListenAndServeTLS`.

* `Addr` → the port number (3000)
* `Handler` → `nil` means use the default `http.DefaultServeMux` (where our `http.HandleFunc` routes live)
* `TLSConfig` → we attach the `tls.Config` we just defined above.

So now, our server *knows* it must use the **TLS encryption layer** for all communications.

---

### 🧩 Enabling HTTP/2

```go
http2.ConfigureServer(&server, &http2.Server{})
```

This line upgrades our HTTP server to support **HTTP/2** — the newer, faster version of HTTP that runs *on top of TLS*.

HTTP/2 improves:

* Speed (multiplexed streams)
* Efficiency (header compression)
* Security (TLS required)

---

### 🧩 Starting the Secure Server

```go
err := server.ListenAndServeTLS(cert, key)
```

This is where the **magic happens** 🔥

* The server loads our certificate and key (`cert.pem`, `key.pem`)
* It starts listening for **HTTPS** requests on port 3000
* TLS is automatically applied for every request/response

Now when a client connects (e.g., `https://localhost:3000/orders`):

1. The TLS handshake occurs (certificate exchange, key negotiation)
2. Once the connection is secure, HTTP requests flow through encrypted channels.

If any middleman intercepts the packets, they’ll see only encrypted gibberish.

---

## 🧩 4️⃣ What Happens If We Use Plain HTTP Instead

If we use:

```go
http.ListenAndServe(":3000", nil)
```

Everything works, but:

* Data (like passwords, tokens, etc.) is sent in **plain text**
* Anyone sniffing network traffic can read it
* No authentication between client and server

That’s why **production APIs always use HTTPS/TLS**.

---

## 🧭 5️⃣ Visual Summary

```
[ Client (Browser / Postman) ]
        |
        |  HTTPS (TLS Handshake + Encryption)
        |
[ Go Server with cert.pem & key.pem ]
```

✅ Server presents its certificate
✅ Client verifies authenticity
✅ Both agree on a session key
✅ Encrypted communication begins

---

## 💡 In Short

| Concept               | Meaning                                             |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **TLS**               | Transport Layer Security (encrypts communication)   |
| **cert.pem**          | Public certificate — tells clients “who we are”     |
| **key.pem**           | Private key — used to prove identity & decrypt data |
| **tls.Config**        | Configures encryption level and protocol            |
| **ListenAndServeTLS** | Starts HTTPS server with encryption enabled         |

---

Let’s break down **each line** in that Postman network info to understand what it means technically, and what’s happening behind the scenes 👇

---

## 🧠 Big Picture First

When we run:

```go
server.ListenAndServeTLS("cert.pem", "key.pem")
```

we’re saying:

> “Start an HTTPS server using these certificate and private key files.”

When Postman connects via `https://localhost:3000`, it performs a **TLS handshake** with our Go server.
Postman then shows us diagnostic info about that secure connection — which is what you’re seeing.

---

## 🔍 Now Let’s Decode Each Line

---

### **1️⃣ Network**

```
HTTP Version: 1.1
```

Even though we configured `http2.ConfigureServer`, Postman might still fall back to **HTTP/1.1**.
This depends on how Postman negotiates the protocol — it prefers HTTP/2 but will downgrade if needed.

* **HTTP/1.1** → Traditional request-response, one request per connection.
* **HTTP/2** → Multiplexed (multiple requests per connection), faster.

✅ Both use TLS for security, so either way it’s encrypted.

---

### **2️⃣ Local Address**

```
::1
```

This is the **IPv6 loopback address** — equivalent to `127.0.0.1` in IPv4.

It simply means:

> “The request is being made to my own computer.”

So ourr Go server and Postman are talking locally on the same machine — no internet involved.

---

### **3️⃣ Remote Address**

```
::1
```

Same as above — since both the client (Postman) and server (Go) are local.
If this were a deployed server, this would show the **public IP address** of the remote host.

---

### **4️⃣ TLS Protocol**

```
TLSv1.3
```

✅ Excellent — this means the **latest, most secure TLS version** is being used.

We configured:

```go
MinVersion: tls.VersionTLS12
```

and Go automatically used the newest available (TLS 1.3).

**TLS 1.3 advantages:**

* Faster handshake
* Stronger encryption defaults
* Removes insecure cipher suites
* Fewer round trips (better performance)

So Postman and ourr Go server successfully agreed to use TLS 1.3 during their handshake.

---

### **5️⃣ Cipher Name**

```
TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
```

This line describes the **encryption algorithm** (cipher suite) chosen for the TLS session.

Let’s decode it:

| Component   | Meaning                                                             |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AES_128** | The algorithm used for encrypting data (128-bit key AES encryption) |
| **GCM**     | Galois/Counter Mode — adds both encryption and integrity protection |
| **SHA256**  | Used for hashing, ensures message integrity                         |

So this cipher suite gives us:

* **Confidentiality** → via AES encryption
* **Integrity** → via GCM
* **Authentication** → via TLS certificate

It’s one of the strongest and fastest cipher suites currently used in modern HTTPS.

---

### **6️⃣ Certificate CN**

```
API Inc
```

**CN (Common Name)** is the name we entered when we generated the certificate using `openssl`.

It identifies *who* the certificate is issued to — in production, this would usually be ourr domain, e.g.:

```
CN = api.example.com
```

But here, since we typed “API Inc”, that’s what shows up in the certificate info.
It basically says:

> “This certificate belongs to API Inc.”

---

### **7️⃣ Issuer CN**

```
API Inc
```

The **Issuer CN** tells us *who issued this certificate*.

Since we created the certificate ourselves using:

```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey ...
```

we didn’t use a real Certificate Authority (CA).
That means **we signed our own certificate**, so the **issuer and owner are the same**.

✅ This is why Postman shows it as a **self-signed certificate**.

---

### **8️⃣ Valid Until**

```
Oct 28 17:05:26 2026 GMT
```

That’s the **expiry date** of our certificate — it’s valid for **365 days (1 year)** from when we created it, unless we changed the `-days` flag in ourr `openssl` command.

Once it expires, clients (like Postman or browsers) will warn us again that the certificate is invalid until we renew it.

---

### **9️⃣ Self-signed certificate**

```
Self signed certificate
```

✅ This is key.

In real-world HTTPS, certificates are issued by trusted **Certificate Authorities (CAs)** like:

* Let’s Encrypt
* DigiCert
* GoDaddy
* GlobalSign

Browsers and tools automatically *trust* those authorities.

But our local certificate (`cert.pem`) is **not signed by a CA**, it’s generated locally — so Postman correctly marks it as **“self-signed.”**

This doesn’t mean it’s insecure — just that it’s **not trusted by default** because *anyone* could generate one.

That’s why browsers show “⚠️ Not Secure” for local HTTPS servers — they can’t verify who we are.

---

## 🧩 What’s Actually Happening Under the Hood

Here’s a quick timeline of what just happened:

1. Postman → “Hey server, let’s start HTTPS.”
2. Server → sends certificate (`cert.pem` with CN=API Inc).
3. Postman → sees it’s self-signed, but still continues (since we’re local).
4. They negotiate:

   * **TLS version:** 1.3
   * **Cipher:** TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256
5. They exchange keys and encrypt the channel.
6. Postman shows us the connection info we pasted.

So from that point onward — all ourr data is encrypted.
Even though the certificate isn’t “trusted,” the **encryption itself is fully functional**.
